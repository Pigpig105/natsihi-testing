<P><FONT FACE="Times">Dear Scouts &amp; Scouters of Monmouth
Council,</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">The Order of the Arrow is a national
brotherhood of scout honor campers. The main purposes of the Order
are to: <br>
1) Recognize those campers, <br>
2) develop and maintain camping
spirit and tradition, <br>
3) promote scout camping, and <br>
4) crystallize
the habit of helpfulness in cheerful service. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times">In order to help
  fulfill our purpose, Na Tsi Hi Lodge #71 has prepared this "Where to
  Go Camping" publication. This  lists a variety of campgrounds and
  information on Quail Hill Scout Reservation and Forestburg Scout
  Reservation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times">Summer Camp is an integral part of a troop's
year-round camping program. Monmouth Council's Summer Camp,
Forestburg Scout Reservation, is an excellent place to hold your
summer camp. Teeming with wildlife and natural resources, including
a 55 acre lake and a 70 foot waterfall, Forestburg is 1200 acres of
unspoiled woodlands in the Catskill Mountains of New York. Merit
Badges are available in aquatics, scoutcraft, handicraft, ecology,
technology, and field sports. Frontier Camp offers wondrous
opportunities for scouts to advance. Mountain biking, swimming,
boating, hiking, outpost camping, shooting, archery, rappelling, and
rock climbing are among the many activities offered at Forestburg.
Units even get to choose their lifestyle for the week. Billett Camp
is serviced by a dining hall while Dan Beard Camp offers patrol
cooking.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">The Camp Promotions Committee of Na Tsi Hi
Lodge #71, in addition to providing this book, offers Camp Promotions
Teams. These teams are available to give presentations on Forestburg
Summer Camp at Troop Meetings, Parents' Nights, Courts of Honor, or
any other suitable place. Presentations can be arranged by contacting
the Camp Promotions Chairman, Camp Promotions Advisor, or the Lodge
Advisor.</FONT></P>
