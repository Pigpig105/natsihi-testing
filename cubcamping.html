<h1 align="center"><strong>Cub Scout Camping</strong></h1>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>What first comes to mind when someone thinks of Scouting?&nbsp; The khaki uniform on some Scout out in the wilderness with a backpack.&nbsp; High adventure in the great outdoors is a big selling point for Scouts.&nbsp; How do we bring that same sense of adventure in the outdoors to the Cub Scout program, by going camping of course?</p>
<p>For a Cub Scout camping can be a fun way to learn about the outdoors.&nbsp; They can learn about plants and animals while having a great time hiking and fishing.&nbsp; They can learn to be good stewards of the environment by participating in conservation projects and clean ups while camping.&nbsp; Camping can also give them a chance to practice teamwork, leadership, and individual responsibility all in one fun filled weekend.&nbsp; So how does all this happen in a camping trip?&nbsp; Like everything else in Scouting planning and following the program.</p>
<p>There are multiple options for Cub Scout camping.&nbsp; These include day camps, resident camps, Webelos den overnight campouts and pack overnighters.&nbsp; Here we will consider the last two camping trips pack overnighters and Webelos den overnights. </p>
<h1>Pack Overnighters</h1>
<p>The pack overnighter might be a Cub Scouts first overnight outdoor experience.&nbsp; The goal is to make this a positive experience for the Scout and the parent or guardian.&nbsp; A key to a successful Scouting career is an interest and enjoyment of the outdoors.&nbsp; A successful overnighter needs a location, activities, equipment, and food. </p>
<p>However, before we go into those details we need to talk about the National requirements.&nbsp; These can be found in the Guide to Safe Scouting, <a href="http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/healthandsafety/gss.aspx">http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/healthandsafety/gss.aspx</a>.&nbsp; At that site there is an online version or a printable copy, it is also available for purchase at the Scout shop.&nbsp; Additional guidelines for planning a pack overnighter are found in Chapter 33 of the Cub Scout Leader Book.&nbsp; The first requirement is that one leader in charge of the overnight must complete <em>Basic Adult Leader Outdoor Orientation</em> (BALOO, No. 34162) prior to the pack overnighter and be on the campout.&nbsp; Second, once a location has been confirmed a Local Tour Permit is required for any locations other than council camps. And finally the location must meet certain standards (Pack Overnighter Site Approval Form, No. 13-508). </p>
<h1><strong>Locations</strong></h1>
<p>As previously noted the location must meet the standards of the Pack Overnight Site Approval Form, Appendix 1.&nbsp; Some Scout councils maintain a list of approved sites.&nbsp; As the inspections are only valid for two years it would be a good idea to update the inspection to make sure things have not changed.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In considering a location there are a number of considerations, travel time, the number of people expected, sleeping facilities and what kind of activities are available.&nbsp; The first two are pretty obvious.&nbsp; The third relates to the use of cabins or tents.&nbsp; If the numbers are not too large and you plan early it is possible to get cabin space for a large group of people.&nbsp; This will depend on acceptable sleeping arrangements.&nbsp; For example, some Scout camps have a large building that can house lots of people in a single room.&nbsp; Other camps may have multiple smaller cabins or a mix of cabins and tent sites.&nbsp; The last issue is perhaps the most important.&nbsp; Most camps will have open space for field games and Scout skills demonstrations.&nbsp; Some locations can offer fishing, swimming, or even things like indoor rock climbing.&nbsp; Think about your program and make sure the location meets your needs.</p>
<p>Appendix 2 lists some possible locations.&nbsp; More locations are available in the Where to Go Camping guide posted on the Order of the Arrow website.&nbsp; These locations are divided into three groups.&nbsp; The first group includes Scout camps such as Quail Hill Scout Reservation or Citta Scout Reservation.&nbsp; All of these camps run Cub Scout or Webelos resident camps so they should meet the requirements.&nbsp; The next group has one entry Monmouth County’s Turkey Swamp Park.&nbsp; In addition to the main park there is a group camping area at Nomoco.&nbsp; This park offers a wide variety of activities including hiking trails, biking trails, open fields, and playgrounds.&nbsp; There is also an orienteering course done as an Eagle Scout project from Troop 18, Freehold, NJ.&nbsp; Details can be found on the troop website.</p>
<p>The final group is state parks that provide group camping.&nbsp; More information can be obtained on the state’s website including other possible parks.&nbsp; Each park has different types of activities.&nbsp; For example, Allaire state park has a radio controlled model airplane club on site that is open to Scout visits.&nbsp; Stokes State Forest has extensive hiking trails and trout fishing.</p>
<h1><strong>Activities</strong></h1>
<p>Now that you have a location what are you going to do for the weekend?&nbsp; One issue is who is actually coming?&nbsp; Are sibling and other family members coming or just the Scouts and their parent or guardian?&nbsp; The following comments assume the latter.&nbsp; If you are starting on Saturday morning you have check in and set up.&nbsp; One thing you want to do during registration is review the medical forms for any allergies or special situations.&nbsp; While people are checking in you need to have some type of activity that does not require a lot of organization.&nbsp; One Cubmaster suggested a scavenger hunt.&nbsp; You might need to have different versions based on age.</p>
<p>After lunch its time for a short hike where the Scouts can continue to work on the scavenger hunt or work on finding specific signs in nature.&nbsp; After that it is probably time for a more organized activity.&nbsp; For example, you could set up a series of stations that feature Scout skills.&nbsp; They could be staffed by a combination of parents and den chiefs.&nbsp; You could even make it like a mini-Klondike and turn it into age appropriate competition.&nbsp; Later in the afternoon there may be time for fishing or some field games.</p>
<p>After dinner, it is time to get ready for the camp fire.&nbsp; Each den should have prepared a song or skit to present.&nbsp; Someone will need to build the fire.&nbsp; They should have been working on getting wood during the day.&nbsp; Make sure to check on the local rules for a fire and to have plenty of fire buckets nearby.&nbsp; After the camp fire the Scouts can do Smores or just go to bed.&nbsp; The parents can turn in or maybe have a cracker barrel.</p>
<p>After breakfast on Sunday morning and clean up its time for one more activity.&nbsp; This might be something related to rank advancements.&nbsp; Each group could work on one of the outdoor pins.&nbsp; Another option would be to have a presentation on Leave No Trace.&nbsp; After all these activities it is time to clean up and leave the area better than it was.&nbsp; </p>
<h1><strong>Equipment</strong></h1>
<p>Having the right equipment will not make for a successful outing but the wrong equipment can ruin the experience.&nbsp; For this type of overnight there are four areas where the equipment will make a difference.&nbsp; The first is shelter.&nbsp; If you are not using cabins then some type of tent is necessary.&nbsp; The size of the tent does not matter as long as someone knows how to put it up.&nbsp; It would be a good idea to suggest that people set up their tent at home to make sure they have all the parts including pegs and ropes before they arrive.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The second item is sleeping gear.&nbsp; Sleeping bags and pads are nice but not everyone has them.&nbsp; If the weather is not going to be too cold you can get away with blankets and pillows.&nbsp; Make sure they bring something appropriate to sleep in. &nbsp;The third item is proper clothing for the weather.&nbsp; This includes clothing that is warm enough for both the day and the evening.&nbsp; Appropriate footwear is required if there is any hiking planned.&nbsp; And finally, never leave home without rain gear.&nbsp; Some type of waterproof jacket is much better than a poncho.&nbsp; A nice list of gear to bring for a pack overnighter can be found at http://www.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/34-49.pdf.&nbsp; One thing it is missing is a water bottle. </p>
<p>The last item is cooking equipment.&nbsp; Once you decide on the menu how are you going to cook it?&nbsp; Is each den going to bring their own cooking equipment or are you going to cook for the whole pack?&nbsp; Unless you are going to do a cold breakfast on Sunday you are probably going to need some type of griddle.&nbsp; For Saturday night you could barbeque.&nbsp; Check with the facility about the availability of grills in the site.&nbsp; Two other aspects of cooking are dishes and clean up.&nbsp; Will you bring paper plates and silverware for everyone or should they bring their own.&nbsp; And finally, you will have some dishes to wash.&nbsp; So you need to bring the classic three buckets for KP and a big pot to boil water as well as cleaning supplies.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Remember that if you don’t have the right equipment reach out to you local Scout troop to borrow it.&nbsp; Troops have tents they can lend and individual Scouts have cots and even extra sleeping bags.&nbsp; Worst case you can rent equipment from stores like EMS or REI.&nbsp; Finally, make sure you think about everything you need as you will probably not be able to run out and get it.</p>
<h1><strong>Food</strong></h1>
<p>The final topic is what to eat.&nbsp; Before you consider the details review any allergy or dietary issues you might have in the pack.&nbsp; There are three meals that need to be planned; lunch, dinner and Sunday’s breakfast.&nbsp; You may also want to plan a snack after the camp fire.&nbsp; There are three ways to do lunch; bring it; cold, or hot.&nbsp; The easiest thing is for everyone to bring a bag lunch.&nbsp; The next easiest thing is to plan on a cold lunch.&nbsp; A simple menu of sandwiches set up as a buffet can work well.&nbsp; The key is to make sure that everyone understands how much to take.&nbsp; And finally a simple hot lunch can be done if the weekend is cool.&nbsp; A lunch of hot dogs and Raman noodles just requires two pots of boiling water.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The dinner menu will depend on how fancy you want to get and how many people are attending.&nbsp; A basic barbeque of burgers or grilled chicken with appropriate side dishes is not too hard to pull off.&nbsp; Another option would be to make it pot luck where each family brings a different dish.&nbsp; You could even make this into a diversity event if people bring foods from their cultures.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Breakfast on Sunday can be cold or hot.&nbsp; For a cold breakfast cereal or some type of pastry works well.&nbsp; You can get the individual boxes of cereal but they are expensive.&nbsp; A hot breakfast can be something simple like egg sandwiches.&nbsp; They have the advantage that they do not need any utensils.&nbsp; One constraint on a hot breakfast is the amount of griddle space you have.&nbsp; If you try to cook for 50 on a single Coleman stove someone’s food will get cold.&nbsp; </p>
<p>There are lots of resources for menu planning just think through your cooking equipment and how involved the Scouts will be.&nbsp; Remember to plan every last detail of what you need for both the food as well as the cooking equipment.&nbsp; For example, you might need salad dressing, spices, oil for frying, and garbage bags for clean up.&nbsp; The same goes for equipment.&nbsp; If you want coffee you need a pot or maybe just a pot of hot water and a ladle.&nbsp; What about things like hot gloves, tin foil, and water jugs.&nbsp; </p>
<h1>Webelos Den Overnight Camping</h1>
<p>Webelos den campouts provide a way to continue the exposure to the outdoors.&nbsp; For second year Webelos it is also a way to expose them to the kind of camping they can look forward to as Boy Scouts.&nbsp; The campout is run by a leader who has taken the Outdoor Leader Skills for Webelos training.&nbsp; The campout may be run jointly with a Boy Scout troop.&nbsp; However here we consider a Webelos only campout.&nbsp; On this campout every Webelo is accompanied by a parent or guardian.</p>
<p>The organization of a Webelos campout requires the same kind of planning as the pack overnighter; location, activities, equipment, and food.&nbsp; The key difference is in the kind of activities and the meals.&nbsp; The activities can focus more on Scout skills and perhaps something more physically challenging like a longer hike or conservation project.&nbsp; The food can also be more involved since you will be cooking for fewer people.&nbsp; Maybe it will be time for that Dutch oven cobbler or salmon on a cedar plank.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Examples of a Webelos campout at Quail Hill Scout Reservation and Forestburg Scout Reservation have been developed and can be found on the Monmouth Council Order of the Arrow Website.&nbsp; These two documents provide a complete plan for a weekend campout including activities and meals.&nbsp; </p>
<h1><strong>Summary</strong></h1>
<p>The key thing to remember for a successful Pack Overnighter or Webelos Den campout is to plan ahead.&nbsp; First plan the event as you would like it to happen.&nbsp; Then think about everything that can go wrong and plan for that.&nbsp; What will you do if it rains?&nbsp; What if someone gets lost, hurt, or just bored?&nbsp; Do you have all the equipment you need for the planned activities and for cooking?&nbsp; Have you talked to the camp ranger to make sure that everything you planned is ok with them or that they will have the equipment you expect?&nbsp; Remember the Scout motto “Be prepared”. </p>
<p>In the end no matter what happens remember that a Scout is cheerful.&nbsp; If you have the right attitude almost any situation can be dealt with.&nbsp; The important thing is that the Scouts have a positive experience.</p>
